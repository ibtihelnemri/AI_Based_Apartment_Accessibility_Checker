## üìù Brief Explanation
This app evaluates the **accessibility** of an apartment for individuals with disabilities by analyzing both images and text descriptions.

Using **CLIP** from **Hugging Face's transformers**, it detects features like ramps, wide doorways, and step-free entrances in the images. It also uses a **zero-shot classification pipeline** to assess accessibility in the text.

You can upload images and provide a description, and the app will generate an accessibility score for each input and a **general confidence score** reflecting the overall accessibility.
